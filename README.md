# Hi there! :D
So, this is my GitHub profile. I'm just someone who loves to learn new cool things and here I am learning all I can about programming.  
Here's a little about me:

# About Me
I'm currently in high school studying an informatics career and so far they have teached me about basic algorithms, a little bit of C++, informatic security and some other related stuff. At the same time, I'm learning by myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I have made some little projects using all of that.  
I'm looking forward to become a full stack developer, maybe with more focus on the back-end because graphical design it's not really my thing hehe. I also like cats and mexican food ðŸ˜¸.

# Goals
Be a happy person.
