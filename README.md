# Hi there! :D 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm just someone who loves learning new and cool things, and here I am, exploring all I can about programming. 🚀

## 🌟 About Me  
- 📚 I'm currently in **high school**, studying an **informatics career**.  
- 🌐 Learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** on my own, and I've built some little projects with these skills.  
- 🖥️ My goal is to become a **full-stack developer**, maybe with more focus on the **back-end** (graphical design isn't really my thing, hehe).  
- 🐱 I like **cats**.
