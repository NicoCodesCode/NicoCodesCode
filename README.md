# Hi there! :D
So, this is my GitHub profile. I'm just someone who loves to learn new cool things and here I am learning all I can about programming.  
Here's a little about me:

# About Me
I'm currently in high school studying an informatics career. At the same time, I've been learning by myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript for and I have made some little projects using all of that.  
  
I'm looking forward to become a full stack developer, maybe with more focus on the back-end because graphical design it's not really my thing hehe. I also like cats and mexican food ðŸ˜¸.  
  
If anything, feel free to contact me through here on GitHub.  
Thanks for reading!
