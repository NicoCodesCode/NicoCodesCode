# Hi there! :D 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm just someone who loves learning new and cool things, and here I am, exploring all I can about programming. 🚀  

## About Me  
- 📚 I'm currently in **high school**, studying an **informatics career**  
- 🌐 Learning web development on my own, and I've built some little projects for that   
- 🖥️ My goal is to become a **full-stack developer**, maybe with more focus on the **back-end** (graphical design isn't really my thing, hehe)  
- 🐱 I like **cats**    

**Feel free to reach out** through GitHub if you'd like to connect or chat.  
Thanks for stopping by and reading! uwu
